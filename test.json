Mozilla has released not one but two major versions of its <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/tag/firefox?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Firefox</a> browser, the first being the increasingly social Firefox 21 on the desktop. The browser's integration with Facebook is now extended to include other partners including Cliqz, Mixi and a msnNOW -- a trio that don't quite offer the same recognition of that first network. However, an open Social API holds the promise for others to follow suit. Facebook 21 also has better support for <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2012/12/15/mozilla-looks-back-at-2012-finds-many-of-us-choosing-do-not-track/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Do Not Track</a> settings and includes what's called the Firefox Health Report, which has the ability to track crashes and make recommendations for boosting performance.</p>\n\n<p>Firefox for Android was also updated, offering new open source fonts, better HTML5 support, an improved UI and the ability to save media files by long-tapping. That is available for download now, as are the various versions for desktop operating systems.

However, customers using it said they wanted more than the web browsing and BitTorrent streaming speed-ups the load-balancing app provided, and were looking for so-called connection aggregation tech that'd allow quicker video streaming, VPN access and Skype calls, too. As a result, the company has just launched Switchboard, a cloud based app that combines all your internet connections but appears as only one IP address.</p>\n\n<p>To make it work, the company built new software from scratch and put together a network of cloud servers across the world. The result is a \"channel bonding\" system that Connectify says will speed up all your online activities: Dropbox or SkyDrive uploads and downloads, Google Hangout video conferencing and video streaming from the likes of Netflix, to name a few. A quick test of the beta software on our end worked fairly seamlessly, requiring just a software installation and two or more internet connections. We also noticed that our IP address appeared as that of the server we were connected to instead of our local address, which could be a bonus for those trying to access their US internet from abroad. Connectify's looking to grab $100,000 in funding this time around, with pledges start at $50 -- so if you're looking to finally click that \"HD\" button on Vimeo, hit the source.</p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/networking/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Networking</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/internet/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Internet</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/software/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Software</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/05/14/insert-coin-connectify-switchboard/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/523076551/switchboard-faster-internet-for-mac-and-pc\" target=\"_blank\">Connectify (Kickstarter)</a><!--//--></p>", "startDate": "2013,5,14,16,0,0"}, {"headline": "Netflix keeps its lead in streaming video use at home, YouTube rules the road", "text": "<p class=\"image-container\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/05/14/netflix-keeps-its-lead-in-streaming-video-use-at-home/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\"><img alt=\"Netflix keeps its lead in streaming video use at home, YouTube rules the road\" src=\"http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/05/sandvine-mar-2013-atd.jpg\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>When we last checked in with Sandvine's stat trackers, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2012/11/08/sandvine-netflix-29-percent-of-north-american-internet-traffic/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Netflix reigned supreme</a> in online video traffic at home, especially downstream. It's still sitting pretty several months later, Sandvine tells <em>AllThingsD</em>. Quite possibly helped by the <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/02/01/netflix-streaming-house-of-cards-premiere-free/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\"><em>House of Cards</em> debut</a>, Netflix kept a healthy lead at 32.3 percent of downstream use on wired networks this past March. That's no mean feat when some of its competition took big strides forward -- YouTube jumped up to 17.1 percent, and Hulu likely rode sweeps season to get 2.4 percent.</p>\n\n<p>In mobile, it's a different story. Netflix use on cellular almost doubled to 4 percent, but YouTube kept an uncontested lead at 27.3 percent of downstream use. It's not hard to see why after looking at other video formats people prefer on the road: raw HTTP video (19.2 percent) and Facebook (8.6 percent) were the next-closest, which suggests that many still grab snack-sized videos on their phones instead of full movies or TV shows. We don't expect the status quo to budge much in the near future, whether it's on mobile or a fixed-line. Without major initiatives from veterans or the arrival of a new upstart, it isn't clear just what would rock the boat.</p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/home-entertainment/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Home Entertainment</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/internet/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Internet</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/hd/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">HD</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/google/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Google</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/facebook/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Facebook</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/05/14/netflix-keeps-its-lead-in-streaming-video-use-at-home/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Via:</strong> <a href=\"http://allthingsd.com/20130514/netflix-still-eats-a-third-of-the-web-every-night-amazon-hbo-and-hulu-trail-behind/\" target=\"_blank\">AllThingsD</a><!--//--></p>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.sandvine.com/news/pr_detail.asp?ID=431\" target=\"_blank\">Sandvine</a><!--//--></p>", "startDate": "2013,5,14,15,36,0"}, {"headline": "BlackBerry Q5 hands-on: an affordable BB10 device in a QWERTY shell", "text": "<p><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/05/14/blackberry-q5-hands-on/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\"><img alt=\"BlackBerry Q5 handson\" src=\"http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/05/dsc06801.jpg\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>It's not the most exciting hardware launch to come from the newly reinvigorated (and rebranded) BlackBerry, but the <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/05/14/blackberry-q5-announced-bb10-qwerty/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Q5</a> is device with a mission.

Initially, however, only the messaging and group features will be accessible for outside users, but throughout the year, the company hopes to add BBM voice, BBM channels, screen sharing and video capabilities. You'll have to hold tight for a more specific launch date, as Heins didn't announce any concrete timing.

The new service allows users search for and subscribe to preferred channels, comment and share posts with friends and also have one-to-one chats with channel administrators. Users can create and curate their own channels as well, with metrics to track the amount of traffic they're receiving. So, it's essentially Twitter, only with a decidedly BlackBerry flavor.</p>\n\n<p>Following the initial announcement, Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton appeared onstage to chat a bit more about the new platform and explained that the service will provide he and his F1 team the ability to communicate more directly and easily with fans. Excited to join Mr. Hamilton on the BBM channel bandwagon?

Now, Microsoft is officially rechristening the platform, and with a more staid name: Windows 8.1.

The application, which can be downloaded for free, charges vendors a credit card processing fee of 1.8 percent plus 15 cents per transaction, assuming you're swiping plastic from MasterCard, Visa or Discover. In an effort to get small businesses signed up, however, Groupon is offering to cover the fees on the first $5,000 in credit card transactions, a savings of $90 by our calculations, plus whatever you'd be paying per swipe.</p>\n\n<p class=\"p1\">The app enables you to log transactions, manage menu items and issue refunds, in addition to processing credit cards and emailing receipts. The POS uses Breadcrumb Payments for processing, with deposits posting within 24 hours, and can be paired with a card swiper and optional printer (you can email receipts if you'd prefer). There's also free 24/7 telephone support, should you run into any issues while using the system. Breadcrumb POS won't replace the more sophisticated Pro version, which is available starting at $99 per month, and retailers will still be able to use the Groupon Merchants App for redeeming vouchers and processing supplemental payments. If the new Breadcrumb POS sounds like a fit, snag some more info at the source link below.</p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/software/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Software</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/05/14/groupon-breadcrumb-pos-ipad-app/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"http://breadcrumb.groupon.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Groupon</a><!--//--></p>", "startDate": "2013,5,14,14,0,0"}, {"headline": "Skype and Moog now available for BB10.1", "text": "<p><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/05/14/skype-and-moog-now-available-for-bb10-1/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\"><img alt=\"Skype and Moog now available for BB101\" src=\"http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/05/dsc06768.jpg\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Amongst the flurry of announcements this morning at BlackBerry Live in Orlando, CEO Thorsten Heins finally made good on an app promise from this past January.

It's a handset Heins is convinced will be a \"big hit\" for its target audience. The portrait QWERTY handset follows in the footsteps of the recently unleashed Q10, merging a 3.1-inch touch screen with hardware keyboard, but has a more specific bent: it's made for emerging markets. Due to be launched in a trio of colors (i.e., black, red, white and pink), the Q5 is being positioned as a low-end device that combines affordability, BB's signature physical keyboard and, of course, BB10. It's due to rollout this July in Latin America, Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia. As for pricing, the company's remaining mum on that end, but with summer fast approaching, we should know soon enough.</p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/cellphones/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Cellphones</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/wireless/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Wireless</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/mobile/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Mobile</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/blackberry/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Blackberry</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/05/14/blackberry-q5-announced-bb10-qwerty/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>", "startDate": "2013,5,14,13,38,0"}, {"headline": "Hamster wheel used to control human-sized treadmill (video)", "text": "<p class=\"image-container\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/05/14/hamster-wheel-human-treadmill/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\"><img alt=\"DNP\" src=\"http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/05/screen-shot-2013-05-13-at-12.15.19-pm.jpg\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Sure, your pet <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2012/08/14/hampture-underwater-colony-established-for-science-leads-the-wa/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">hamster's</a> amazing leg strength may someday <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2009/02/27/jacketed-hamsters-demonstrate-movement-powered-nanogenerators/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">power a house</a>, but can it beat you in a race?

The team cautions that no animals were harmed during this experiment, however a human ego may have been bruised after trying to keep up with a tireless rodent.</p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/science/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Science</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/alt/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Alt</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/05/14/hamster-wheel-human-treadmill/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"http://danbertner.wordpress.com/work/hamster-treadmill/\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel Jay Bertner (Blog)</a><!--//--></p>", "startDate": "2013,5,14,13,31,0"}, {"headline": "Twitch video platform for gamers comes to Xbox 360, watch and play from the same place (video)", "text": "<p class=\"image-container\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/05/14/twitch-xbox-360/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\"><img alt=\"Twitch gaming video platform comes to Xbox 360, watch and play from the same place\" src=\"http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/05/twitchfor360jt.jpg\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>How does a dedicated gamer relax when they're finally beat on <em>Call of Duty</em>? Surely by <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/30/call-of-duty-black-ops-2-adds-live-twitch-streaming/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">watching others</a> suffer the same fate, right? Well, now that just got even easier with an official Twitch app for Xbox 360. The game-centric video service finds a natural home on the console, which could go some way to augment the platform's already 34-million strong audience (or at least prevent hundreds of wasted gaming calories used when switching screens). It's not clear if there will be the option to bring your <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/02/04/twitch-launches-premium-turbo-service/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">premium credentials along</a> with you. But, we do know the app will bring access to the top 300 live Twitch channels, albeit initially only for Xbox Live Gold subscribers. Still, as a dedicated gamer, you probably already are one, right?</p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/gaming/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Gaming</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/05/14/twitch-xbox-360/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>", "startDate": "2013,5,14,13,0,0"}, {"headline": "Hands-on with NVIDIA Shield: NVIDIA's project turned product", "text": "<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/05/14/nvidia-shield-hands-on-final/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\"><img alt=\"Handson with NVIDIA's project turned product, NVIDIA Shield\" src=\"http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/05/shieldhed619pxwmed.jpg\" /></a></div>\n\n<p>NVIDIA's Project Shield now has an official name (NVIDIA Shield), a release window (\"by the end of June\") and a price tag ($350). That's a full $100 more than the PlayStation Vita -- arguably the most competent competition for Shield's hardcore skewing demographic -- and even a smidgen over the cost of various full-on game consoles. Despite the high barrier to entry, NVIDIA tells us Shield will follow the same annualized model that its mobile phone counterparts do: a new internal upgrade each year to keep up with the times. And we already know <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/03/19/nvidia-mobile-roadmap-logan-and-parker/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">what that future looks like</a>. Given all that baggage, we can't help but approach our last hands-on before launch with an eye toward whether or not this is a worthy purchase.

The specs haven't changed -- it's still rockin' a Tegra 4 processor with 2GB of RAM, a 5-inch \"retinal\" IPS display (1280x720), and 16GB of storage (expandable to 64GB via microSD). The concept remains nigh identical with what NVIDIA head Jen-Hsun Huang <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/07/nvidia-project-shield-tegra-4/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">introduced back at CES</a>: a console-quality controller with an HD screen mounted to it for on-the-go and streaming PC gaming.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond the price point and release window, the Shield is also getting a few new game announcements in Double Fine's <em>Broken Age</em> and <em>Costume Quest</em>, not to mention a new iteration of <em>Chip's Challenge</em> named \"Chuck's Challenge.\" The <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/tag/ardrone/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">AR.Drone folks</a> are also adding in support for the Shield, enabling controller-based inputs over the motion-based usual. NVIDIA's also promising monthly OTA updates for the system, including the latest version of Android (the system ships with Jelly Bean 4.2.1). The company also warns that not all Android apps will work out of the box -- specifically, any that don't support landscape mode (the Netflix login screen, for example, has an issue here). Kinks aside, should you wish to be the very first to get a Shield, it's available for pre-order starting right now on NVIDIA's website (if you're on the mailing list, that is), or on May 20th everywhere else. Or you could sign up for the mailing list, of course.</p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/gaming/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Gaming</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/handhelds/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Handhelds</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/mobile/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Mobile</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/nvidia/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">NVIDIA</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/05/14/nvidia-shield-350/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>", "startDate": "2013,5,14,13,0,0"}, {"headline": "Microsoft adds built-in Google Talk to Outlook.com and SkyDrive.com", "text": "<p class=\"image-container\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/05/14/microsoft-adds-google-talk-to-outlook-dot-com-skydrive/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\"><img alt=\"Microsoft adds builtin Google Talk to Outlookcom and SkyDrivecom\" src=\"http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/05/outlook.comgoogletalk.jpg\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Make no mistake, we don't just like Outlook.com; we <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2012/07/31/outlook-preview-email-service-microsoft/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\"><em>love</em></a> it. The problem with Microsoft's revamped email service, though, is that ditching Gmail can be a tough sell, as it's meant giving up features like built-in Gchat. At last, though, Microsoft is adding support for Google Talk, which means you can keep sending your friends dancing-parrot videos even after you make the switch. (Outlook.com still does Facebook and <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/04/30/skype-for-outlook-com-preview-launches-in-the-uk-coming-to-the/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Skype chatting</a> too.)

To clarify, this feature is only coming to the Outlook and SkyDrive <em>websites </em>for now -- Dharmesh Mehta, Sr. Director of Outlook.com, told us Microsoft is still considering how GTalk might fit into its mobile apps. In the meantime, though, you can load up Outlook in your browser if you want a peek. And don't worry if nothing shows up right away: the company is warning users that the roll-out could take several days.</p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/internet/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Internet</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/microsoft/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Microsoft</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/google/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Google</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/05/14/microsoft-adds-google-talk-to-outlook-dot-com-skydrive/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"http://blogs.office.com/b/microsoft-outlook/archive/2013/05/14/outlook-com-now-lets-you-chat-with-google-friends.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft</a><!--//--></p>", "startDate": "2013,5,14,13,0,0"}, {"headline": "Nokia marketing head: Customers' 'biggest complaint' is missing apps", "text": "<p class=\"image-container\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/05/14/nokia-marketing-head-the-biggest-complaint-is-missing-apps/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\"><img alt=\"Nokia marketing head 'The biggest complaint is that customers are missing the apps they want'\" src=\"http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/05/apps.jpg\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>We managed to grab a quick chat with Nokia's Global Head of Smartphone Marketing, Vesa Jutila, following the global launch of the <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/05/14/nokia-lumia-925-hands-on/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Lumia 925</a>. When asked about the still-notable absence of some mainstream apps within Windows Phone 8, Jutila was surprisingly frank. With reference to the company's Lumia series, he said that \"the biggest complaint is that customers are missing the apps they want.\"</p>\n\n<p>Nokia has been on a recent charm offensive towards Instagram, not least with a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nokia/status/324486903258824704\">mini Twitter campaign</a>, but it announced earlier today that a new <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/05/14/hipstamatic-windows-phone-8/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Hipstamatic Oggl app</a> will be headed to Microsoft's mobile OS, capable of sharing through Twitter, Facebook and, yes, Instagram. However, for users coming from other platforms, they may find some first-party favorites missing -- with things like <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2012/12/14/editorial-windows-phone-future-without-google/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Google+</a> and <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/tag/AmazonCloudPlayer/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Amazon Cloud Player</a> being just a couple of examples.

He added:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"[Developer attention] is very much driven by the absolute volume of Windows Phones in the market. That's why we're so pleased when other manufacturers also make Windows Phones.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When asked if Nokia has a strategy for a scenario in which it becomes the <em>only</em> manufacturer of Windows Phones, Jutila replied \"No, we don't have a strategy <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2012/02/08/nokia-we-dont-have-a-plan-b/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">for that</a>.\"</p>\n\n<p><em>Sharif Sakr contributed to this report.</em></p>\n<p>Filed under: <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/cellphones/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Cellphones</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/mobile/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Mobile</a>, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/category/nokia/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\" rel=\"tag\">Nokia</a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/05/14/nokia-marketing-head-the-biggest-complaint-is-missing-apps/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget#comments\">Comments</a></strong></p>", "startDate": "2013,5,14,12,33,0"}, {"headline": "Hands-on with Nokia JobLens on the Lumia 925: what a way to make a living (video)", "text": "<p class=\"p1 image-container\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/05/14/nokia-joblens-hands-on/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\"><img alt=\"Hands-on with Nokia JobLens on the Lumia 925: what a way to make a living (video)\" src=\"http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2013/05/job-lens-lead.jpg\" /></a></p>\n\n<p class=\"p1\">We're hoping we won't need to use Nokia's JobLens app for real any time soon, but at the <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/05/14/nokia-lumia-925-hands-on/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">Lumia 925</a> launch event, we thought we'd at least explore our options.

In another mode, JobLens uses the Here Maps platform to show you a top-down view of openings in your vicinity, and can subsequently direct you to your interview on time. From either views, you can poke at vacancies to see more about the job and share it, email it to yourself, or respond directly with a CV -- various sites populate the in-app listings. The software also integrates with Facebook and LinkedIn so you can hit up your contacts for the inside track. No word on a release date yet, but we imagine it'll coincide with the Lumia 925 <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2013/05/14/nokia-lumia-925-UK-vodaphone-o2/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">launch</a>.

Its signature product, known as the LeafPresenter, is an Android-based tablet with a funky lip on the top right that allows for mag-stripe credit card transactions. While the first-gen version of the device has been out for some time, Leaf is ready to branch out later this summer with a new model that offers more functionality.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to a newer forked version of Android (Leaf OS), the upcoming LeafPresenter throws in <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2011/06/10/engadget-primed-what-is-nfc-and-why-do-we-care/?utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget\">NFC</a>, EMV and gift card support, as well as a 2MP front-facing camera, 1,280x800 display and better battery. Last but not least, the new device also includes support for a Leaf-branded third-party app store geared toward small business usage. While there's no specific cost to the tablet itself, business owners will need to fork over $50 per month for the opportunity to use it.
